## Overview

### Objective

Convert a Figma design of an event management dashboard into a fully functional, responsive webpage for both web and mobile versions. Only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are requiredâ€”React is not necessary. Dark mode is a bonus. Use placeholder data where needed. The webpage must match the Figma design exactly on both web and mobile without improvisation.
